And finally Technology.\\n\\nEach platform is designed to provide a tool covering the entire industry value chain through a series of modules & services. Each covers a separate part of the value chain, can stand alone in its own right, has its own unique competitors but interlinks with the other modules.

This training data is prepared by labeling unlabeled raw data.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCurrently, manual labeling is what is commonly used.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nManual data labeling has the following key pain points:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1. The labels are prone to human errors especially if the annotators don't have the right domain knowledge.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2.

Data privacy can also become an issue with manual data labeling companies not being able to ensure 100% data privacy at scale.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt Expand AI, we have automated the data labeling process to solve the key pain points that exist with manual data labeling:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1. We provide >95% accurate labels regardless of the domain the data belongs to because our ML models can be made to be domain-specific very easily.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Our ML models can label each data point in one second on average and as a result, we've been able to reduce the turnaround time by at least 70%.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Because we use ML models to annotate data we can charge per example point instead of per annotation point and as a result, we're able to reduce unnecessary spending on data labeling.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4.
