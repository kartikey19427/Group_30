We're a mission-driven and diverse team composed of world class talent from Coinbase, Google, Meta, Bitso, Citi, Spotify and other top companies. We are a remote-first and fully distributed company, with team members located across all of the continents besides Antarctica. As early pioneers in the space, we've made significant technical contributions to various Ethereum standards over the years; fun fact - our team helped establish the NFT token standard (ERC721).

In joining us, you'll take part in transforming the way that value is exchanged on a global scale. We're passionate about open-source software and decentralized technology's potential to act as an equalizing force in the world, and our technology is deployed by a wide array of projects at the forefront of internet and economic advancement.

Founded in 2017, 0x Labs created and now partakes in the development of 0x protocol: the open-source, global backbone for decentralized exchange. Alongside the core protocol, we also build and maintain products and service offerings including Matcha, the search engine for tokens, and 0x API, the endpoint for multi-chain aggregated liquidity. All of these offerings allow 0x Labs to continue marching towards our vision of building a tokenized world where all value can flow freely at the best prices and with the lowest transaction costs. This way, we can help businesses eliminate the complexity of accessing decentralized markets across all layers of the Web3 exchange stack and have more time to focus on what matters most: their product.

0x currently supports 8 major blockchains: Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, BNB Chain, and Celo, and the 0x ecosystem has been rapidly expanding. With integrations across all of the top wallets and apps, including MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet and Coinbase NFT, Polygon Wallet, Brave, Matcha, dYdX, Zapper, Zerion, and Shapeshift, 0x is fast becoming the trusted standard for all decentralized exchange.

We're a remote-first company with core contributors in nearly ten countries and over twice as many cities. Our headquarters is in San Francisco, with an office available for anyone on the team to use at any time. We'll consider your application regardless of where you call home.

Responsibilities

Create and improve the suite of tools that enable the entire 0x ecosystem to interact with the 0x protocol

Work effectively with a high degree of autonomy, within a collaboratively minded team

The ability to learn and adapt to a rapidly evolving tech stack

About Shaya by CaratLane :




Our Origin :




It all started with our CaratLane community, many of whom were also into silver jewellery but couldn't always find what they love. They told us that the designs available in the local market were often too generic. Plus, they were never sure of the authenticity of their purchases. We wanted to change that!'




On 24th September 2018, our website HeyShaya.com went live with 220 designs across 4 unique themes. The response has been phenomenal.




Our Muse :




At Shaya, we love telling stories that celebrate and inspire women.




Our Signature Style :




We make art wearable. Indian motifs, patterns, and forms inspire us a lot. We like to add our own twist to what's been done before.




Our Team :




We're a small team ( a start-up incubated within CaratLane). We hustle, negotiate hard, and work within a lot of constraints (particularly wrt budget and time). Most importantly, we strongly relate to Shaya and what she stands for. We are looking for someone who is equally passionate about building and growing Shaya. Someone for whom this is not just “another job”.

About VORTO

We are building software which enables businesses to be more economically and environmentally sustainable by digitally transforming the supply chain.

About The Role

You’ll work with our CPO and our product and engineering teams to design interfaces that simplify complex problems. You’ll work primarily on designing mobile and web applications with a focus on ease of use and minimizing time to market.

We are a fast paced, high intensity team and can get somewhat obsessive about the problems we are solving. To be honest: we don’t have the luxury of much work-life balance at this point in our company’s growth.

You will design interfaces taking into account the unique needs of each category of our users:


Thousands of truck drivers and small fleets who use our 5F Trucking Platform (https://5f.app/) as a business-in-a-box – like a “Shopify of Trucking”.
White collar professionals at large shippers (Pilgrims, Olam, Halliburton, et. al) who use our analytics and automation tooling to automate their supply chain.


Responsibilities


Work directly with our CPO, product and engineering teams to rapidly solve the highest impact problems for our customers.
Immerse yourself in the business & company strategy to design holistic solutions.
Have a primary focus on UI/UX design (90% of your time), but as an early design hire you will take a “whatever needs done” approach to handle other miscellaneous projects (e.g. design a trophy for winners of an in-app challenge).


Requirements


Bachelors in Graphic Design or similar
7+ years of experience designing user interfaces.
Can quickly and easily understand a problem and design a solution.
Experience creating storyboards, workflows and UI using Figma.
High Impact: You’re a self-starter who can proactively identify opportunities for impact even when they’re not assigned to you.
Low Ego: You enjoy collaboration, feedback, and iteration.
Need for Speed: You are fast to respond to messages. You like shipping, and are willing to make hard tradeoffs in order to get features in the hands of customers.


Compensation: $75-150k

Benefits

At VORTO we are committed to developing our employees and providing them exciting opportunities to grow and prosper in their careers. We encourage you to visit our careers page and read this blog post to learn more about our culture.

Competitive compensation package

3497656403,Business Analyst,Seraphine,"What We Stand For

We are the leading scale player in a specialist market – maternity and nursing wear – with 20 years of experience behind us doing this and nothing but this.

But what we do at Seraphine is more than just fashion and clothes. We help women feel confident in their changing bodies and enable them to continue to express the choice and style they had prior to pregnancy and during pregnancy, whilst providing them with product innovations that make motherhood a breeze.

What We’re Delivering

We are highly international (more than 2/3 of our sales are from markets outside of the UK) and highly digital – we were an early embracer of eCommerce and the channel now represents 90% of our revenue. We’re also a digital marketing machine: acquiring customers profitably from first order, with more than half returning for a second order during the current pregnancy and more and more coming back to us again when the family grows further. This all contributes to market leading profit and product margins and our double-digit growth rates across the world put the rest to shame.

But we’re just getting started. With plans to significantly expand in our key markets in the next 12 months and to add more acquisition channels, we’re really in the sweet spot. We have significant momentum – but we’re still small enough that you’ll see your impact every day.

Workplace and Culture

Always motivated by new innovations in technology – we are a team of driven and ambitious individuals. Fuelled by the success of achieving market leading results, we place great importance on resourcefulness and dependability and encourage inquisitive questions that challenge us to see things from all perspectives.

We do what we love and push the boundaries on a daily basis – you need to be excited for that. We foster the habits of go-getters and are always in search of exceptional people from various walks of life, with diverse experiences to join our team.

Purpose of the role

Reporting to the Lead Business Analyst, you will work with stakeholders to review problems and opportunities to understand real business needs. You will analyse and clearly document requirements, working with a small team to validate proposed solutions. The solutions will involve changes to technology, people and process and you will be key to implementing change and ensuring success is measured.

As a business analyst, you will be exposed to a variety of business areas predominantly focused on back office operations including merchandising, product information and lifecycle management, operations and customer service, and will be required to use differing analysis techniques and documentation types as appropriate.

You will have wide-ranging business analysis experience and enjoy working in a dynamic environment across multiple projects and initiatives at various stages in the project lifecycle. You are confident with all types of analysis and can flex outputs and communication to meet the needs of the project and stakeholders.

You are obsessed with outcomes, ensuring that they can be measured, and that the solutions implemented will have the biggest positive impact.

Initiatives may require a tactical and strategic view, so you will be comfortable defining an MVP or pulling out quick wins whilst also considering longer term requirements or larger scale change.

Requirements

Work with the Lead Business Analyst and business stakeholders to scope projects and change
Elicit requirements using a variety of techniques such as interviews, requirement workshops, observation, and document analysis
Ensure requirements are clear, concise and unambiguous and that they are structured in a way that can easily be communicated and reviewed with stakeholders

Understanding what our customers want, what the business wants, and what is technically possible is no easy challenge! You’ll be able to understand these (sometimes conflicting) needs and synthesise them into something tangible.



We have 7 teams that build our products, and you’ll manage the end-to-end delivery of products coming out of either Payments or Safe Play teams. You don’t need to know too much about what these are just yet, we have plenty of domain expertise already that will only be too keen to help you learn.



What you’ll bring is that innate inquisitiveness, innovation and intelligence to see where value can be added, and which ideas are worth pursuing (and which ones aren’t).



The reality is that priorities change, some things will work better than anyone expected, and some won’t. You’ll need to be constantly looking at what’s being done and what needs to be done, asking “How are we helping our players?”



You don’t need to be a Product Manager right now. If you can talk to us about how you can manage these competing priorities, always bringing fresh solutions to the needs of customers, then we’d like to chat.







Stuff you’ve possibly done in the past:



Listened intently to customers; understood what they want and what’s possible
Come up with new ways of delighting customers.
Changed your viewpoint. If the information changes, so does your opinion.
Stood up for what you believed in and took people with you.
Influenced others, especially those with fancier job titles than yours.
Spun plates! (If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs…)

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

To solve this problem, we expanded into software and built integrated solutions to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time.

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

To solve this problem, we expanded into software and built integrated solutions to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

If you're looking to work at a high-growth company, drive impact on widely used products and change the way the restaurant industry works on a global scale you will find this role compelling, challenging, and rewarding.

You Will:

Work closely with restaurant owners and staff to deeply understand their needs, what keeps them up at night and how they run their business and serve their diners
In collaboration with design, engineering, marketing, and analytics partners, lead the end-to-end success of projects from discovery to launch
Identify new growth opportunities through quantitative research, UX studies, and reviews of industry standard methodologies
Influence and inspire key stakeholders and cross-functional peers and executives throughout Square to align intent, resources, and prioritization and deliver excellent products and services


Qualifications

You Have:

Minimum of 3 years of consumer-facing product management experience
Passion for our purpose of economic empowerment and helping sellers succeed
Strong customer empathy and experience shaping product direction based on customer needs
Create solid relationships that shine when you're talking with a customer, cross-functional partner, or engaging a diverse audience

The Product Manager is the magic in the middle of our product teams. Understanding what our customers want, what the business wants, and what is technically possible is no easy challenge! You’ll be able to understand these (sometimes conflicting) needs and synthesise them into something tangible.




We have 7 teams that build our products, and you’ll manage the end-to-end delivery of products coming out of either Payments or Safe Play teams. You don’t need to know too much about what these are just yet, we have plenty of domain expertise already that will only be too keen to help you learn.




What you’ll bring is that innate inquisitiveness, innovation and intelligence to see where value can be added, and which ideas are worth pursuing (and which ones aren’t).




The reality is that priorities change, some things will work better than anyone expected, and some won’t. You’ll need to be constantly looking at what’s being done and what needs to be done, asking “How are we helping our players?”




You don’t need to be a Product Manager right now. If you can talk to us about how you can manage these competing priorities, always bringing fresh solutions to the needs of customers, then we’d like to chat.




Stuff you’ve possibly done in the past:

Listened intently to customers; understood what they want and what’s possible
Come up with new ways of delighting customers.
Changed your viewpoint. If the information changes, so does your opinion.
Stood up for what you believed in and took people with you.
Influenced others, especially those with fancier job titles than yours.
Spun plates! (If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs…)

So why—despite the huge leaps we've taken in design and usability—does most business phone software still look, feel, and act like it was born in the 90s? OpenPhone is changing that.

We're a new type of business phone with a mission to help people communicate better and be more productive.

Create product specs for customer-facing features and tasks related to our backlog that moves the needle for our customers and the business

That growth has been a combination of organic coupled with an aggressive period of acquisitions that has seen us snap up some of the biggest names in our space – BioPharm Insight, PharmSource, I.H.S Life Sciences on the Healthcare side.

We provide 18 Intelligence Centers / Industry platforms, enjoyed by over 4000 clients, but our core offerings are in 4 main area’s.

Industrials which segments to Oil & Gas, Power & Utilities, Mining and Construction. And finally Technology.

Each platform is designed to provide a tool covering the entire industry value chain through a series of modules & services. Each covers a separate part of the value chain, can stand alone in its own right, has its own unique competitors but interlinks with the other modules.

The account manager position has two goals: onboarding new clients, and relationship management with those same clients throughout their customer lifecycle with TrueCover.




This is a custodial position, not a 'hunter'. We have broad channel distribution, so this is not a direct sales or revenue role. Our channel partners submit business to us, and for accounts where we are the winning quote, you will be the first interaction the client has with a party unfamiliar to them: TrueCover.




The overarching aim is to promote awareness of our product offering, ensure adequate compliance with reporting requirements, and begin and sustain the client relationship with TrueCover in a positive and constructive way.




You will:

serve as the customer’s first interaction post-sale and the face of TrueCover throughout onboarding and ongoing client communication (not including claims activity)
ensure customer records are kept up-to-date and documents on file are accurate and in compliance with reporting requirements
execute a highly organized onboarding experience with explicit goals, timelines, and expectations for ongoing processes including claims submissions
work closely with Claims to ensure all steps in the handoff between Accounts and Claims are complete and thoroughly documented
guide customers on proactive risk mitigation methods available through TrueCover resources
partner with executive leadership to provide insights into improving the customer experience
evaluate customer claims data to recommend safety programs that improve customer's business practices
build consistent rapport with customers by conducting scheduled account reviews and updates on account progress
formulate and execute plans to provide consistent customer updates to the relevant channel partner(s) that sourced the relationship for TrueCover and determine if additional support is needed
support customer retention by partnering with Underwriting to provide competitive pricing throughout the customer lifecycle
partner with management as needed to reduce account risk by escalating account concerns




We hope to find someone who has:

three or more years of account management experience
a track record of skillful negotiation, persuasion, organization, and problem-solving
experience demonstrating considerable tact, diplomacy, discretion, and judgment with the ability to build and maintain effective interpersonal relationships
comfort communicating in both small-talk and high-pressure scenarios
excellent time management skills and the ability to assume ownership on projects while juggling other tasks
the ability to learn and work effectively in a virtual environment
a fast pace of learning and a facility with or ease of working in a dynamic, imperfectly predictable environment
strong alignment with our values (shared below)




TrueCover is committed to a culture of responsibility and collaboration. We know that how people treat each other is the key determinant of success. Certain principles enable our culture of thoughtfulness and high performance:




Respect: we value diversity and treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or role at the company.
Collaboration: we encourage open communication and sharing of ideas, and work together to achieve common goals.
Accountability: we expect team members to have sticky fingers for responsibility and to take ownership of their work. (Examples of this include meeting deadlines, following through on commitments, being accountable for any mistakes made, and communicating proactively at all times.)
Critical thinking: we prioritize strong problem-solving skills and look for people with a natural habit of reflection or innate drive to improve their skills.
Adaptability: we welcome change, embrace new ideas, and practice intellectual honesty; there is no need to always be right.




We believe that by living these values, we enable a positive and supportive work environment that empowers both people and strong business performance.

About Us

Vouch was created by husband and wife duo Simon and Jaime Tillyer. Their vision was to create an innovative, tech driven solution to the existing, clunky and time-consuming referencing services in the lettings industry. They wanted a system that actually worked, and didn't cost the earth.

Today that vision is a reality, and our business has grown from strength to strength.

You’ll be part of a young, successful team with a relaxed atmosphere that allows you to both deliver and grow and expand your skills.

On top of that, here’s a few of the things that our existing team loves about working for Vouch:

🌴 23 days annual leave, plus bank holidays, plus your birthday off!

🚀 Learning and Development budget via Learnably

✨ Pension scheme

And some other perks are:

💻 Flexible working & hybrid working

🐶 Dog friendly office with our most regular fluffy visitors Oscar and Bruno

🍿 Office snacks

🎉 We work hard but enjoy letting our hair down with plenty of team socials

🤗 Exposure to the Goodlord group and the opportunities to progress that come with that

Vouch wants applicants from all backgrounds and walks of life, we are an equal opportunity employer committed to creating an inclusive environment. If there is anything you need to participate fully in the interview process we'd like to hear about that too, please just include it in your application. Come and join us!

Your role is a multi-faceted one. Your ‘To Do’ list will be expansive and evolving. And you catch the things others have missed to keep a project moving.



What you’ll do

Creative judgement - develop good creative judgement. Know the work across your Clients’ category, and what ‘Best in Class’ looks like across the creative industry. Above all be creatively interested and round out your view on what makes great, on-brief work.

Energise the process with clarity of task and a spirit of action - help create the right conditions for creative excellence with clarity of task and action. You’ll have a clear handle on all outstanding actions, communicating clear and concise next steps to everyone. Ensuring everyone is clear on who is doing what. You’ll then usher the process along with a softness of touch to ensure everyone is accountable for their actions. Your mentality is that a sent email doesn’t mean its ‘done’. Manage upwards to your AD in a timely manner, knowing when to escalate or get a Creative / Strategist / Producer.



Have healthy paranoia: think ahead so that you and your AD can plan for and anticipate problems and opportunities on projects.




Cash

Share regular competitor reviews and general things of interest as a way to keep the client and your team updated and inspired/ energised.

Culture



Cultural beacon - you see your role of energising and contributing to the team culture as key. You bring good energy and optimism - even on the smaller tasks - to everything you do.



Proactive energy - you adopt a proactive mindset. Suggesting next steps and watchouts rather than waiting to be asked.

You will have direct impact on a product that serves tens of thousands of conversations daily in one domain today, and you will help scale the platform to serve millions of conversations daily across the first one hundred domains.




Responsibilities:

Design, build and scale entire components of the platform
Collaborate closely with product and machine learning engineers to deliver a data centric AI platform
Learn and drive engineering best practices. We build software for developers

EliseLabs actively develops three product categories:

Standalone APIs serving individual components for the conversational AI lifecycle: data exploration, human labeling, model training, deployment and inference
A platform providing an integrated development environment to create automated conversational agents
Conversations as a service, a concierge service to implement automated or partially automated conversations for our enterprise client with custom integrations




Why join

Growth and impact. It’s not often that you can get in on the ground floor of a funded startup that’s scaling. That means that instead of following a playbook, you’ll be writing it. Every single day you will be challenged to identify how we can scale and execute on it. You’ll learn what works when you succeed and what doesn’t when you fail. Either way, the rest of the team will be here to support you.




Compensation & Benefits

In addition to the growth and impact you’ll have at EliseAI, we offer competitive salaries along with the following benefits:

Top of personal market compensation (base salary range is between $225,000 and $380,000, flexibility for uniquely qualified candidates)

Does delivering impact while building scalable, robust AI applications excite you?




Here at Expand AI, we are automating the data labeling process to help AI companies build high-performing ML models.




A high amount of training data is required to train the ML model to perform accurately. This training data is prepared by labeling unlabeled raw data.




Currently, manual labeling is what is commonly used.




Manual data labeling has the following key pain points:




1. The labels are prone to human errors especially if the annotators don't have the right domain knowledge.




2. It takes a lot of time to manually annotate data, with annotators taking weeks or months to label data depending on the volume and the use case.




3. The manual data labeling process is costly with manual data labeling companies charging per annotation.




4. Data privacy can also become an issue with manual data labeling companies not being able to ensure 100% data privacy at scale.




At Expand AI, we have automated the data labeling process to solve the key pain points that exist with manual data labeling:




1. We provide >95% accurate labels regardless of the domain the data belongs to because our ML models can be made to be domain-specific very easily.




2. Our ML models can label each data point in one second on average and as a result, we've been able to reduce the turnaround time by at least 70%.




3. Because we use ML models to annotate data we can charge per example point instead of per annotation point and as a result, we're able to reduce unnecessary spending on data labeling.




4. We ensure 100% data privacy at scale.




AI/ML at Expand AI




A tangible impact on customer/patron experiences is the constant cornerstone for 'models in production.' Curiosity, humility, continuous learning, excellence, and a bias for action - are a few words that summarize the colleagues you will be collaborating with across engineering, product, and business teams. Some of the problem statements being solved at Expand AI with AI/ML are:




Generating highly accurate labeling predictions for data points in a very low turnaround time - one second per data point (image/sentence) on average.
Making it easy to make the models domain-specific so that the models can give accurate predictions for any use case that the data may belong to.




Qualifications:




Bachelor's/Masters's degree in Computer Science or any other STEM degree. Preferably graduated with high distinction.
Should have extensive experience with building ML models in a company setting for commercial purposes and should have a good understanding of different ML algorithms.
Must have specialization/strong expertise in sub-area like recommendation systems, NLP, computer vision, and MLOps.
Working know-how of dealing with large-scale data sets.
Clear spike in either dealing with extensive data, statistics, driving impact, ML algorithms know-how, and DL architectures.

About Omnitail

Our number one goal at Omnitail is to offer greater accountability and performance for our clients. The digital marketing industry suffers from a lack of transparency and integrity among agencies and vendors. We aim to change this trend by teaching our clients to measure success through profit, rather than just revenue or efficiency. We incorporate measures of COGS, VOH (variable overhead) and merchandise return rate (MRR) in our optimization process. We pride ourselves on working with each client to find the approach that works best for their specific business needs. Success through metrics like profit - not just revenue - equals greater accountability, integrity, and transparency: and that’s what Omnitail is all about.
