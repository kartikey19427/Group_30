About
I lead the product management function at Vectara.

Prior to Vectara, I led the product management team for Kong's API gateway. Prior to Kong, I led the globally-distributed product management team for Elasticsearch at Elastic.

My passions lie in bringing value, ease of use, and utility to demanding software developers and coaching & enabling product managers on my team to do the same. I believe in being data driven, product-led growth, and making calculated risks that may go against convention. I believe strongly in hiring product managers with diverse cultures, backgrounds, and experiences to challenge my own opinions.

About
I’m a product manager at LinkedIn — and before that, a product marketing manager and strategist in technology and digital media. I love most working with cross-functional teams to build products that solve complex problems for customers and deliver meaningful business results. My 6 years of experience in product development, growth marketing, machine learning, marketplaces, and cybersecurity have taught me to fail and learn fast, in order to understand customer needs with confidence and drive key business metrics. I have a keen ability to think strategically about the big picture, while maintaining a fierce attention to detail and a get-it-done attitude, and I care deeply about making technology work for the media companies of the future.

About
I'm Shobhit Chugh, and I help Product Managers position themselves to become Product Leaders, so they raise their income by as much as 50%, command the respect their hard work deserves and have an intentional career and life they can be truly proud of.

But I cannot help everyone. I can help people who:

🟣 Know they are ready to make a bigger impact as a Product Leader
🟣 Have what it takes to land the dream job in a top tech company while being known as part of the top 1% of Product Managers while feeling like you're making a BIG difference in the world.
🟣 Want to focus on the strategic initiatives that will move their company and career forward.

If you are one of these people, start here =>
https://www.intentionalproductmanager.com/workshop.

In case you think I'm full of it, here's what a few clients have to say:

""Thanks to IPM, my self-framing has changed dramatically. If I was unsure how to position myself on the job market before, now I'm in a job that I love, and I feel like I have the key for future success."" - Oana, PM at Meta

""As a result of what I learned, I got a promotion I've been working towards for a long time to Director of Product Management. But, not just that–I was also made Head of Product for all four sister companies and will soon be adding four more people to my team."" - Chris Ruhter, Director of Product

""I joined the program when I started my job search. The coaches helped me understand the interview expectations for the Product Management role, especially at FAANG companies. It also provided a great platform to practice my interview responses. The feedback shared during practice sessions contributed to my interview success.

In the end, I applied to one dream job and got it - a Senior Product Manager role at Amazon!"" – JP, Senior Product Manager at Amazon.

I work with clients to build and practice both hard and soft skills like persuasion and influence, storytelling, prioritization, and strategic thinking. Their value - and confidence - goes through the roof.

When product teams become more effective at creating value in the world it translates directly into higher revenue and exponentially higher profits - via individual and team coaching and workshops.

You can get a taste of my approach in my podcast, The Secrets of Product Management and my book The Secret Product Manager Handbook.

ABOUT ME: I have 20+ years of experience in enterprise software product management, discovering market problems, creating powerful and innovative solutions, and helping sales and marketing teams be more successful in selling those solutions, in demos, positioning, handling objections, and all the other intricacies of sales enablement.

I love responding to new challenges with new ideas. I am constantly inspired by insights from disparate disciplines as abundant sources of ideas and innovation. I know there's (nearly) always a solution to any problem, and I'm optimistic and enthusiastic about pursuing the answer and creating a solution.

About
I am an award winning graphic designer based out of New Haven, CT with a background in print, web, and video. In 2008 I earned a bachelor’s degree in graphic design from Southern Connecticut State University which landed me a job at a small New Haven design firm designing environmental graphics, booklets, and banners for Yale University. I then moved west to pursue an MFA in Communication Design from Texas State University in San Marcos, TX. During my time at Texas State, I worked as a graphic designer for the university, filming and editing lectures, designing graphics for faculty, and collaborating with others on university projects. In 2016 I received the Thesis Research Support Fellowship from Texas State for my thesis work on French typographic design.

About
I began my career in UX with the Wall Street Journal in 2010 after grad school (Chapel Hill). In 2013 I moved on to help form the new Yahoo mobile product office in New York, primarily prototyping and researching for their various media properties. During that same time, I began teaching UX classes at General Assembly and Parsons. In 2015 General Assembly and Grand Central published my first book The Practitioner's Guide to User Experience Design. I left Yahoo for a full time teaching position that would begin in NYC and end in Singapore, lasting a year and half.

Today I live, work and teach in Los Angeles.

About
In high school, I participated in a special program that prepared a small number of talented students for the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI), and I learned C/C++ programming, data structures, algorithms. Thanks to this program, I realized how much I loved programming and solving interesting problems by utilizing different algorithms. This experience sparked my interest in studying Computer Science at college and pursue a career as a Software Engineer.

Apart from programming, I am interested in fashion, and I enjoy traveling and watching movies (huge Marvel fan!).

About
In 2017 I couldn't sleep until I quit my full-time job at a software development consulting agency. 😲

After 20 years in various software engineering roles, making great money, and working for many prestigious companies – I was a victim of serious burnout!!!


So I began the journey to heal myself, and soon realized the entire software industry needs healing.


Now I work for myself.

I help consulting clients with software projects part-time in the morning –

…and I coach professionals like you, who work on software teams, in the afternoon.


The career coaching services I offer are not just for programmers, software developers, and software engineers.

I also help QA engineers, DevOps architects, project and product management professionals.


Jayme Edwards Coaching is my business for helping you be sustainable about pursuing success in your career!

You don’t have to “hustle and grind” to make it in this business – you just have to be smart and set boundaries.

Watch my YouTube channel ""Healthy Software Developer"" for more of my story, or visit jaymeedwards.com to learn about the healthy career coaching solutions I offer.

About
With 15+ years in the field of design and 10+ of those years as an influential design leader at companies like lululemon, Amazon, Nordstrom, and Microsoft—I thrive when I’m creating an inspiring, inclusive workplace where talented people are empowered to be the best version of themselves, and motivated to deliver outstanding customer experiences and business results. 

My greatest value is my ability to cut through complexity and find the heart of the matter. I am obsessed with the customer and digging deep to understand the “why”, which allows me to see the bigger picture and connect the dots in new and inventive ways. I am not afraid to think differently, challenge the status quo, and drive ambiguous high visibility initiatives.

My passion is in defining an inspiring customer experience vision, and unifying and energizing teams around a common strategy that gives people clear focus and purpose. I believe that the experience customers have with a product on the “outside” is a direct result of how the organization functions on the “inside”.

Plus, I like to have fun. :-)

Specialties:
• Fosters a thriving creative culture, where team members feel supported, empowered, and happy to come to work.
• Attracts top UX talent and cultivates growth and career development that is focused on team members’ unique strengths.
• Relentless focus on—and vocal champion for—the customer.
• Strong command of user-centered design practices, visual design, and interaction design.
• Drives inclusion by working across multiple teams to gather diverse inputs and ensure all voices are heard in discussions and decisions.
• Inspiring, effective communicator who gains support and buy-in at all levels of the organization through research, data, and persuasive storytelling.
• Brings structure and clarity to work when faced with ambiguity by turning ideas into a clear vision and plan of action.

About
I am a self driven UI/UX designer with a background in graphic design that specializes in grid based layouts, typography and rapid prototyping. I participated in full life cycle developments of multiple products from small start up products to large cooperation products. I am familiar with every step from preproduction through ideation to prototyping; meetings with stake holders; Geobeta to world wide launch and from live support to even sunsetting products.

As a senior UI/UX designer, I coached and mentored new team members and less experienced team members. I would create detailed style and process guides, then work with them with real tasks that are at first easy, then very difficult. Trial and error is a very good learning system. I would touch base with them and my leads often, to make sure everyone is aware of everyone's progress. I pride myself on being detail-oriented, organized and very responsible. My strengths can be demonstrated in some of my key achievements. I am always on top of the schedule and proficient at delivering high caliber work through iterative design, solid implementation, and interaction with the team.

I am excited to work with people from cross disciplines and to take on greater challenges. I don't believe that any one is a single person team. I love fast pace work environments and I believe that the right environment can foster the opportunity for me to become an even better designer.

About
See my UX portfolio at danielnullmeyer.com
 
My background in psychology as a student, researcher, and peer counselor, has taught me the power of empathy in human-centered design. My work as an educator trained me to communicate complex ideas in an understandable fashion. My legal experience gave me a logical process and technical writing proficiency. And I combined all of these into a career in UX by attending DESIGNATION.

Today, I focus on user research and an iterative design process to ensure I listen to users and build better products.

About
I have worked in the consumer package goods industry for 7+ years, ultimately gaining experience in Sales, data reporting, analytics, database knowledge, client relations, syndicated/panel data, and became proficient in all Microsoft office tools.

I am a team member always willing to help or go the extra mile for an assignment whether big or small. Being on a team with members all over the nation has let me gain experience in building relationships with associates in a much more rounded way.

Currently, I am responsible for the Analytical support for the Sales team that represents Southeastern Grocers. I support my team by providing a variety of analytic and financial reporting while also giving an analysis to present the data in to a story via excel or power point. I create presentations that show trends, promotions, trade, space to sales, brand/item dollar opportunity, and panel data to expand the growth and sales of our brands in specific retailers.

About
I’m a detail oriented problem solver focused on creating sales data reports that foster smart business decisions and bring light to training opportunities for the Direct Sales Operations team. In my current role I contribute to the company’s Direct Sales business efforts by querying product sales and commission data from multiple sources and provide management with clarifying sales data reports in a concise actionable format.
Before joining the Direct Sales Operations Team, I supported the Small Medium Business (SMB) marketing efforts while on the Spectrum Business Learning and Development Team where I created engaging interactive training content that resulted in quick knowledge transfer of sales tactics and product knowledge to the SMB sales teams in the field.
Prior to the Spectrum Business Learning and Development Team, I worked for two separate entities of the construction and engineering departments at Charter and was lucky enough to gain experience designing Hybrid Fiber Coaxial Network architectures, supervising and providing technical support to HFC Design employees and creating ad-hoc reports to analyze business patterns and communicate performance to senior leaders.
While I enjoy all aspects of my job, I think my favorite stage of a project is working directly with the sales professionals and their leaders to gain a better understanding of their processes and use the information as a means to gain further insight into the sales data and communicate more relevant and actionable information to management.
I have a BA from the University of Central Florida in Psychology and focused AA studies in computer programming and CAD design. I am very interested in the role that technology plays in gathering and extrapolating data on human behavior.
I’m always interested in hearing from former colleagues, managers, or just interesting creative folk, so feel free to contact me if you’d like to connect.

About
After 11 years in Product and over 5 years as a Product Management Instructor, I coach Product Managers full-time - and love it. 

I spend the majority of my time helping aspiring Product Managers to get PM jobs by leveraging their existing skills - all in 90 days.

Getting into Product Management shouldn’t be rocket science. My tried and true four-part FAIR™ method has helped driven professionals to become first time PMs, doubling salaries, despite a pandemic.

I also coach new and existing PMs to navigate their everyday challenges ranging from “Help! I just started as PM and need help navigating my first 90 days” to “Double help! I have an internal opportunity for a promotion and I need guidance”.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed with your transition into Product, you’re in the right place: send me a message to get started.

About
A passionate creator and builder looking to change the world. I wake up excited to learn and grow every day. At Meta, I get to build product helping billions of people around the world develop strong connection and community with others through working on Emerging Intent, Reels, Stories, and Messaging features. Prior to Meta, I worked in several roles (I.e. product, finance, and corporate strategy) across several products (i.e. Mint, Turbo, Quickbooks Enterprise, and TurboTax) to help improve the financial lives of millions of people and businesses.

In addition to my passion for business, product management, and FinTech I am also passionate about life and the adventures it brings. A fitting title may be, ""An active outdoor recreational enthusiast that loves cycling, rock climbing, surfing, snowboarding, boating, scuba diving, and any other adventurous activity ending with ...ing.""

I've been blessed by the gift of time and support from generous mentors throughout my career. I'm trying to pay it forward myself. If you're an aspiring product manager or currently working as a product manager and feel like I can help you in some way please feel free to schedule time with me. I keep every Wednesday from 5-6pm PST free for two 30 min meetings to help mentor, chat about product, and learn from others.

About
If you are looking to start a business analyst career, succeed in a new business analyst role, earn your business analysis certification, or even bring best practices and standards to your business analyst team, you are in the right place!

I’m Laura Brandenburg, Founder and CEO of Bridging the Gap and author of How to Start a Business Career. Our mission is to help you become a confident, sought-after business analyst with practical, real-world online training and certification.

Since 2008, I’ve helped thousands of professionals start and succeed in business analyst careers. I started my business analyst career back in 2003, after a few years as an editorial assistant (where I was bored out of my mind) and quality assurance engineer (where work got interesting).

My goal is to empower you to take charge of your career and become a confident, sought-after business analyst.

Our flagship offering is The Business Analyst Blueprint® certification program, where participants can earn their Applied Certification in Business Analysis™ (ACBA). The program includes:

>>>Foundational Business Analysis Skills: With practical, real-world online training, you’ll learn techniques and processes that elevate your career potential in any industry or type of project.

>>>Real-World Application that Builds Credible BA Experience: With hands-on instructor coaching and documentation reviews, you’ll create vetted work samples showcasing your experience while making an immediate positive impact on your current projects.

>>The ACBA Certification that Brings You Recognition: With a credential that documents your on-the-job application (no multiple choice exam required), you’ll be seen as an official and certified business analyst, which can open up new career opportunities within and beyond your current organization.

We run 2 public sessions each year Visit our website for information. We also offer private cohorts for teams. Get in touch with me directly for details.

For both individual BAs and BA teams, we also offer a variety of digital downloads and business analyst template toolkits to quickly support you in getting better results from your projects, and the BA Essentials Master Class which goes through our 8-step business analysis process framework to help you run your projects more effectively.

If you’d like to learn more visit our website at: http://www.bridging-the-gap.com.

In addition to our courses and templates, you’ll also find hundreds of articles and videos about business analysis and our free Quick Start to Success as a Business Analyst workshop.

About
I enjoy collaborating with stakeholders and teams in an end-to-end process to create digital product solutions that integrate business goals, user needs and delightful experiences. I usually start with blue-sky ideas that are then vetted and refined by broad and deep research, user requirements and understanding of technical dependencies.

I have 10 years of experience in the design industry as a visual, UX and UI designer. I have had the opportunity to lead projects for clients from diverse industries and work in multidisciplinary teams (designers, project managers, strategists and developers) to deliver outputs. Working directly with clients and stakeholders has given me the opportunity to gain valuable insights into business, user and customer needs, and I draw upon them to craft solutions that are focused and effective.

I aim to explore and incorporate various disciplines of design like cognitive design, product psychology, inclusive design and intuitive prototyping in my work.

(She/Her)

About
👋🏻 Hello! I'm Alicia (uh-lee-see-uh), a data-driven, UX/product designer with a natural curiosity for the little intricacies that make everyone unique.

🧙 I'm passionate about design systems – creating with an accessibility and inclusivity first mindset, enabling success for both design/dev teams and end users, and oversharing all the neat things I'm learning along the way. Not to mention, the feeling I get about becoming a Figma wizard is absolutely thrilling.

💡 I'm also a nerd for research and analytics. You can say it carried over from my coursework in biology, chemistry, and psychology. In the world of UX, I love digging deep to the root of the problem and ensuring my design solutions are backed by data. Working together might entail me geeking out over my latest projects and discoveries (and yours too)!

✨ When I'm not moving squares in Figma, I love spending my time learning new recipes and improving my Mandarin and Cantonese.

About
Hello! 

As a UI/UX Designer with over eight years of experience, I bring a wealth of knowledge in creating and directing User Interfaces, User Experience, and User Research for Digital Products.

Currently based in Zurich, originally from Brazil, I have had the opportunity to work for a diverse range of companies, from small startups to large enterprises. I am working as a Staff UX Designer at SmallPDF, where I am responsible for the mobile app, focused on innovating and improving the experience for the users.

With experience in both B2B and B2C solutions, I have a proven track record of creating and maintaining mobile apps. I am also well-versed in end-to-end processes such as client workshops, user research and interviews, A/B testing, user flow, wireframes, and product launch.

I hold a postgraduate degree in App and Interface Design from Idep Barcelona. Additionally, I am passionate about side projects and frequently give lectures on the possibilities of working as a designer around the world.

Some of my key skills include:

Developing UI/UX workflow and design
Problem-solving and creative resolution-making
Information design and data analysis/visualization
Wireframing and prototyping
Proficiency in Adobe Suite, Sketch, Figma, Flinto, and After Effects

Fluent in English, Spanish, Portuguese, and proficient in Catalan, I have strong presentation skills and am always open to new challenges and discussions about design.

About
Hello! My name is Lucy, and I’m a UX Designer with prior experience in qualitative research. My research background translates into using real-world insights to inform design decisions and guide projects. I’ve always been interested in human behavior and how consumer products are packaged for each target audience, which led me into the field of UX design.

I’ve worked on a variety of user-centered projects from mobile to responsive web, in the ad tech and e-commerce industry, for start-ups and non-profits. I’ve previously redesigned a company’s provider portal web page; designed wireframes and user flows for brand experiences on Spotify, Billboard and other digital platforms; assisted companies in crafting their online and print experience, and created materials e.g. ads for social media platforms.

I have an MFA in Design and Technology from Parsons, and I’ve also done a UX Design Immersive Program at General Assembly. I've lived and worked in a few different places outside the U.S., including Hong Kong and Japan. l also love cookies.

I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Twitter working in Ads Prediction; spearheading app install ads ranking with a focus on foundational infrastructure and core ML modeling for install and click prediction rate across multiple display locations like Timeline Feed, Tweet Conversations, Search, etc.

I have experience driving projects spanning ML model quality and performance improvements (viz. conversion rate, cost per install, revenue), feature engineering (feature addition, imputation, and importance pipelines), iOS app tracking transparency remediation, and privacy-preserving.

I have been honored with varied awards in AI and Open Source namely, Women of Impact, Next Generation Leader of the Year, Outstanding in AI, Young Role Model, VentureBeat
Women in AI Rising Star Award, Moxie Women in Tech, Chief Data & Analytics Officer, Empowering Women Innovator of the Year, and so on.

I am also one of the few ML Google Developer Experts globally.

Last year, I co-authored a book titled 'Sculpting Data for ML' that campaigns for a data-centric approach to ML and is a practical guide on curating quality datasets. My latest research titled ‘Do not fake it till you make it!’ is a synopsis of trending fake news detection methodologies on social media using deep learning, published in a world-renowned Springer book series.

Having graduated from the University of California, San Diego, with a Master’s degree in CS and an AI specialization, my journey is highlighted by a myriad of experiences from my brief stints at Facebook, the National Research Council Canada, and the Institute of Research & Development France involving data science, mathematical modeling, and software engineering.

I am an avid proponent of open-source and credit my career growth to this sphere of community development. I am also the proud recipient of multiple scholarships for my research and travels like Mitacs Globalink, Linux Foundation, Facebook GHC, ESUG, GHC India, etc. I currently lead the open-source and ML track for Anita Borg's IWiC group, co-lead the Women@ML BRG at Twitter, and serve as the Program Chair at PyBay.

About
Contact: Kaan.Bicakci@wtwco.com

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with:
- Good knowledge of Python and related libraries: Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy ..
- Mathematical knowledge of how ML/DL algorithms work
- Understanding of basic data structures and algorithms

Aside from work,
- I read up-to-date research papers that are related to DL and try to implement the proposed solutions/networks. I also write blog posts on Medium in Turkish since resources in Turkish for ML/DL and TensorFlow is scarce.

My Medium Profile: https://frightera.medium.com/

- I answer questions on Stack Overflow, usually contribute to TensorFlow/Keras/ML/DL tags.

I am a Senior Director of Product Management at LinkedIn, whose vision is to create economic opportunity for all workers globally. I was a Product Manager at Bizo, a B2B marketing company, until LinkedIn acquired us. I also co-founded SameGoal, an education technology SaaS company. As VP of Smart Solutions, I led product management, sales, marketing, recruiting, and customer service. I have an MBA from Columbia Business School and undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Psychology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I did economic consulting at Charles River Associates. My passion for creating web-based products started in 1999, when I co-founded Yourworks.com, an early social network to share user-generated art, music, and code.

About
Hi, I'm Betsy! I'm a Machine Learning (ML) engineer who is currently working as a ML Engineer II at Hired. I have my Masters in Computer Science from Columbia University Graduate School of Engineering, where I specialized in ML. In school and in my day-to-day work at present I use Python heavily, but in my previous roles I worked primarily in Ruby on Rails, as well as Javascript and Java.

I am an energetic self-starter. I studied Architecture and Math at Columbia, and transitioned to being a software engineer over the course of a few years following college after discovering my love of the coded universe.

I like working in places that have a creative and lively culture, as well as smart, kind people who I can learn from and who will laugh at the jokes I occasionally make at daily stand up. I am particularly passionate about ""Algorithmic Justice"" (see: Coded Bias documentary if you haven't yet), and working to monitor and mitigate discriminatory impacts in ML / AI / STEM at large. I have found that I am motivated by being part of a team of people that I admire and want to make proud, and that the specific industry / nature of the product I am working on is less important to me.

About
Throughout history, storytelling has been a critical aspect of our society. Those that held the stories, held the information and could pass it on from community to community and generation to generation shaping the way our world interacted. I spend my days searching through numbers to find the best stories. Sharing the narratives that impact our business and making sense of the endless data we receive.
As Analysts we have the responsibility to interpret data in meaningful ways and bring insight into decision making that would be lost without us. We are receiving so much information that many are often paralyzed by its magnitude. My goal each day is to help people pare this info down and open their eyes to both the forest and the trees.

About
I caught fire coding. 

I always thought my dream was to be a proofreader for a little indie publishing company, sipping my cafe con leche and reading the opening lines to the next best-selling vampire novel. It seemed like an appropriate dream given my BA in English. I gravitated toward proofreading and quality control positions and even started my own proofreading business. But I kind of just felt meh. I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something different.

And that's when it happened; the spark I was missing ignited the instant I clicked play on my first Python tutorial video. (I mean seriously, how could it not be great when it's named after Monty Python's Flying Circus?) Since then, I can't get enough. Web development calls to all my passions; it incorporates creativity and problem solving and I'm allowed to break it to improve the code (in a separate Git branch, of course).

I love applying responsive design principles and watching my web pages shrink into mobile screens and still look amazing. It's oddly satisfying. I think in a way I'm kind of like those web pages; I'm moldable, but I still keep my creative flare intact.

My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving, domain driven design, responsive design principles, website optimization, and the Model View View Model (MVVM) and Model View Controller (MVC) methods of organizing code. So far I have C#, .Net Framework, SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Angular, and Git/GitHub under my belt. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head.

About
Technology has always been a backbone in my way of life since I was 10 years old and first had the chance to use a computer and ever since I have built about 15 of them and been teaching myself how to code as a developer. I have recently developed experience building dynamic full stack apps, working both independently and collaboratively (Github Workflow) to create innovative and simple ideas and bring them to life on the web.

Math has always been one of my favorite subjects growing up and I feel it shows in my code as I am constantly thinking about how to bring forth a new approach to handle old algorithmic problems and I constantly strive to be a better version of myself by chasing the person I plan to be 10 years from now.

When I am not coding out projects you can usually find me enjoying one of the new hot video games and contemplating how on earth a team can code out something so beautiful and make lines of code come to life like this.

If you're interested in seeing my work I have my portfolio listed below and I am always open to opportunities to work as a Front-End Developer!

About
Experienced product professional with deep expertise in product development and marketing. Currently working as senior director of product management at GitHub for GitHub Actions. I was previously at PagerDuty as director of product marketing for incident response.

Before PagerDuty, I worked at Chef Software Inc. in a variety of product and engineering roles on Habitat, Chef Automate, InSpec, and Chef (now Chef Infra). I started my career at Chef as a post-sales field engineer.

Prior to Chef, I worked on cloud infrastructure automation and operations for SecondMarket, Inc., a New York-based alternative markets startup that was eventually acquired by NASDAQ Private Market. Before that, I worked for nearly a decade at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in various roles: developer, system administrator, project manager, and operations manager. I led the team that managed all content delivery, publishing and streaming media systems for CBC.ca, the largest media website in Canada.

Specialties: Project Leadership: Experience managing multi-million-dollar projects across geographically dispersed teams. Strong ability to connect with technical and non-technical stakeholders using presentations and written communications.
Technology: Systems architecture, Internet engineering, UNIX administration, large scale systems development and maintenance.
Media: Writing, editing, politely asking impertinent questions a/k/a reporting.

About
Hi! I'm currently the Head of Product for Amazon Halo, where I lead Technical Product Management and Program Management teams working on 1st party hardware, software, mobile apps, cv/ml/ai powered features/capabilities, growth & engagement tech, consumer subscriptions/membership, 3rd party device and service integrations, science/r&d projects, etc.

About Me:

I’m a tech-obsessed, creative, high agency, strategic, and confident technical product leader that loves getting deep in the weeds to create incredible 0->1 products for customers. As a product, business, and engineering leader, I have experience starting and scaling products from zero to tens of millions of customers. I am passionate about hiring, developing, and mentoring product talent, having built and managed several product management organizations from scratch.

My skill-set is broad spanning software and hardware technical product management, engineering management, product/business strategy, business development, user/market research, marketing/advertising/PR, product design, and more.

At home, I moonlight as a hobby coder (<3 javascript) where I build apps, tools, scripts, websites, Alexa skills/Google Actions and more to scratch an itch or prototype out ideas. Getting out of my comfort zone and learning to code has benefited me a million times over professionally and personally.

I'm always looking for the next challenge at the office and at home, whether it's the next tough role or a new programming framework. I'm at my best when I'm learning new things, being creative, driving business impact, leading and partnering with a great groups of people.

Say hi. Let's grab coffee.

"Tanisha Sabhaney (She/Her)

About
Marketing specialist with analytical expertise who uses data science techniques to solve complex business problems. Recently graduated with an M.S. in Marketing Analytics.

From Seattle to San Francisco to Dubai, I’ve used my marketing analytic skills to help diverse tech/PR companies understand consumer behavior through market research. Since many of these companies were fast-growing startups, my projects were self-driven. They required flexibility and decisiveness by leveraging data. Some of my responsibilities included conducting market research, running UX interviews, and A/B testing ad creatives through social media campaigns.

Prior to marketing, I explored a career in public policy. The public sector helped me identify my three biggest strengths:
1) Finding trends in patterns and identifying consumer perceptions and opinions. The most pressing issues for citizens are comparable to customer-focused pain points.
2) Having research-driven and data-backed solutions are key to creating strong outcomes.
3) Communicating with diverse teammates and stakeholders is essential. Sometimes nobody in the room has an answer, so the best thing to do is to leave the room and find those who do.

The lessons I gained led me to pursue my M.S. in Marketing Analytics and fueled my ambition: to add value by helping teams produce and market products that are meaningful, enjoyable, and effective.

I am passionate about marketing and am always seeking new opportunities to explore, learn, and grow.

About
Design for me is creating or giving form to a kaleidoscope of emotions, which are in turn felt by the different senses of the user and thus giving the best possible user experience.

In my 6 years of experience as a UI/UX Designer, I have learned to manage multiple projects, work in tight schedules, present novel designs and concepts to top stakeholders. My strength lies in maintaining a collaborative environment and open communication with all team members.

Currently working as a Product Designer at Uplift. Graduated Masters in Information Experience Design (with distinction) from Pratt Institute, New York. Skilled in UI Design; UX Design, Research, Testing; Mobile Application Design; Conversational UX (VUX and VUI); Design Strategies; Data Analysis. With a keen interest in photography, dance, music, and arts, I believe in weaving aesthetics into our lives to make it more beautiful and satisfying.

In fact, my first impression of good design comes from the wheel and how a simple aesthetic translates into such a multitude of functionalities. The wheel is one of the key components in every aspect of life. It’s like a building block, a single piece which is perfect in itself yet if you add another one it doesn’t lose its design aesthetic. My journey with design has centred around minimalistic aesthetics without losing functionality.

About
I strive to make things simple by emphasizing the roots and designing apps that people can easily use. I am passionate about finding ways to solve a problem, observing human behavior, understanding psychology, and being full of creative ideas. 

I create intuitive and beautiful user experiences from conception to implementation, while constantly challenging myself and learning new skills in research and user experience. I have worked on several different projects and delivered great user experiences. For a glimpse:

One complex project was B2B and for a Germany-based client, the requirement was pretty hard to implement as it was based on a database maintained by the client throughout his 15 years of career. The data was pretty huge. I understood and analyzed the data and normalized it into various categories. I generated easy & intuitive user flows that the client liked and decided to kick start the implementation.

I also have experience in B2C projects where one project was about preparing for competitive exams. Similar to many other projects, I planned and executed UX research. I prepared and shared the survey questionnaire with 250+ prospective users. The survey included subjective questions to have a deep understanding of user requirements. I analyzed the responses and then designed the features with priority. The mobile app was a success in its very first launch.

I also revamped many web apps, for one project I converted 108 pages website into 8 pages website by improving the workflows & information architecture which led to a simplified user experience.

"Ali Petrizzi (She/Her)

About
I'm a UX designer who enjoys creating empathetic experiences and impactful solutions for users.

Currently, I work at Victoria's Secret. As a member of the Shop Group, I strategize, design, and enhance user experiences across our home pages, category pages, listing pages, and product pages on our global e-commerce platform.

Besides obsessing over UX, UI, and graphic design, I enjoy hiking, spending time with family/friends, and spoiling my cats (I'm a huge pet lover). On rainy days—or during a pandemic—you can find me creating DIY projects and organizing literally anything.

Fun fact: I'm a twin (but we're total opposites)

About
Creative, intelligent computer software developer with a proven track record and 20+ years of experience. Expertise in many aspects of application development, including database design and implementation, stored procedure creation and code writing. Have helped consulting companies place more consultants with high profile clients.

While at Discovery Communications, I decreased downtime of our servers by over 75% by creating and implementing techniques to insure continuous functionality of the servers. I wrote a program to poll the servers and put the status on a dashboard, and also started 6 AM remote checks on the servers.

While at Black & Decker, I took control of a non-functioning, behind schedule ASP and SQL application, and delivered it on time with a surplus of functionality. It was so well received, that more features were requested and I was given a team of two other developers with which to implement the design. I created a basic design that (prior to SharePoint) implemented many of the features that would later become part of Microsoft SharePoint.

Specialties: Web and application development using Microsoft tools, JavaScript and XML. Full life cycle development. Verbal and written communications. Solving complex problems. Recognizing inefficiencies in work processes and implementing solutions to increase efficiency. Leading small teams of developers.

About
Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer with an advanced degree in statistics and 10 years of expertise across machine learning, data science, software engineering, and econometrics. Results and detail oriented with the ability to translate research level ideas into working product and a proven ability to be a technical change agent within an organization.

At my role at the Federal Reserve I was a combined software engineer, data engineer, and data scientist working to turn world class economic research into working production code. In one group I worked on modeling the high-level interplay of monetary policy with economic output, labor markets, and prices. In another role I worked on forecasting next quarter’s GDP, modeling the probability of recession, and estimating the cyclical state of the economy. I wrote a new data store that tracks all of the vintages of the time series (over two million) the Board uses in their daily work and is now used by hundreds of research staff. I also advocated and implemented software modernization projects switching to version control and open source languages.

About
Early in my career, I was asked about my definition of a great product and how I would approach product management to create great products. My answer was – A good product motivates consumers to use it, and as a product manager, my goal would be to understand what motivates the consumers of my product.

After 10+ years of leading product teams in the telecom, hospitality, revenue management, and retail eCommerce industries, I have realized that good product leaders inspire their teams to create products that consumers love to use.

I lead a product team at Lowes that owns a portfolio of strategic platform products in my current role.

As a servant leader, my focus is always towards:

➤ Mentoring and growing individuals to take on more significant challenges.
➤ Developing results-oriented, customer-focused teams.
➤ Fostering a culture of grass-root innovation based on validated learning.
➤ Building a vision and strategy that is backed by data-driven decision-making.

I have an MBA in Technology Strategy from the Georgia Institute of Technology and a BS in computer science.

My journey has helped me build a broad perspective about leading cross-functional teams that solve challenging customer problems with great products.

Through my career experience, I have amassed expertise in leading teams, creating brand awareness, analyzing data, and implementing projects to positively impact organizational goals.
Recognized by executive management as a dependable leader with abilities to contribute as a team player, coach, and organizational mentor. I serve as a strategically-minded visionary leader credited with combining business analysis, process improvement, consultative sales, and personnel management experience to lead profit-driven organizations in highly competitive business markets. Beginning from harnessing data provided into making relevant inbound decisions to creating market-intelligent and analytical
solutions, I possess solid expertise in managing the assigned region's pipeline through account targeting, prioritization, strategic planning, and forecasting.

My career includes a broad range of highlights and accomplishments, such as:
·Championed the process of driving process improvement initiatives and executing successful projects through organizing planning sessions as well as prioritized operations and coordinated with the senior management team.
·Promoted corporate growth through streamlining the delivery of exceptional support services to core business units and implemented annual standard policies focused on aligning employees with business objectives.
·Piloted the process of aligning accounts with business objectives through remodeling and executing client plans such as presence, promotions, and pricing while targeting, acquiring, and developing using propriety CRM systems.
·Earned management's recognition in updating client accounts on business, opportunities, successes, competitive activity, and opportunities through performing monthly, quarterly, and annual business reviews.

Implementing hands-on strategies and providing personal contact, I believe, is essential to building successful business relationships. My focus is to uphold
your company's exceptional reputation for exceeding client expectations and generating superior shareholder
returns.I welcome the opportunity to explore my potential contribution to achieving benchmarking results that impact your operations, revenues, and bottom line

Recently completed a year-long registered apprenticeship learning the ropes of software development, and eager to begin a junior role. From the start of my IT career as a software support specialist, to QA testing IoT devices, and eventually application development I've been able to get pretty comfortable with the entire SDLC. My ultimate goal has always been to apply the programming skills I've acquired with my educational background in the physical sciences.

About
I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Course Hero (part of Learneo), an online learning platform. I focus on building Machine Learning systems for educational document understanding, text classification and question answering processes. Previously I have worked at IBM Data and AI Watson group, as an Advisory Software Engineer, where I helped build and scale Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Knowledge Discovery systems for Enterprises. I have completed Masters in Computer Science from North Carolina State University, where I focused on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and worked on research for Modeling Human Cognition from Input Device Analytics.

My key interest has been to improve education using Artificial Intelligence and to bridge the gap between human mind and digital knowledge. I have worked on several aspects of Artificial Intelligence including Knowledge Graphs and Deep Learning.

About
As a data analyst with a background in digital marketing, I have always been passionate about joining the art and science together to help organizations get the right message in front of the right audience.

Throughout my career, I have focused on solving problems around sales and marketing efficiencies and effectiveness. Using my strong math and science background and my experiences in virtually all areas of digital marketing, I produced successful results like doubling organic site traffic and cutting cost/lead in half over just one year.

I currently work as an independent data consultant specializing in data analysis for sales and marketing. As an independent consultant, I am able to focus on each client’s most pressing top-level challenges, whether that’s creating a brand new method of measuring campaign success, or optimizing a lead scoring model that’s currently in place.

My greatest strength is that I am both a data analyst and a digital marketer, not just one or the other. By combining my data skills with my marketing knowledge, I make sure that I’m looking in the right places to find the best solution for each problem. My areas of expertise include: inbound marketing, marketing automation and CRM systems optimization, lead scoring, and omni-channel campaign analysis. My specialty is in the small to mid-sized B2B space, including start-ups.

About
I have over 10 years of experience working in product management and business strategy. Currently, I am a director of product management at Twitch, where I am the product leader for all non-advertising revenue products. I lead a team of talented product managers who are responsible for helping content creators make a living doing what they love. I find it fulfilling to help people find community around shared interests, large or small.

Some of the recent wins I'm most proud of are:
• Gave creators tool to fundraise for charity in a safer way, raising >$500K for charity within 3 months
• Launched first iOS subscriptions product with >10K SKUs, increasing retention by XX percentage points
• Led direct report to identify new $XB opportunity, resulting in funding new engineering team and direct report’s promotion to principal PM, the first principal PM promotion in org history

Before joining Twitch, I worked as a management consultant at Boston Consulting Group (BCG). I spent the majority of my time working with tech and private equity clients, with case work focused on technology commercialization, growth strategy, and strategic due diligence. Prior to BCG, I obtained my MBA from MIT after four years at State Street, where I worked as an internal consultant redesigning and implementing a new operating model for the firm.

Outside work, I love staying active, watching and discussing film, and playing games with friends. My current obsession, reignited during the pandemic, is chess. In my off hours, you'll often find me playing chess online or at my local chess club.

I'm always happy to meet people who share my passions. If you think it makes sense to connect, please reach out via email at long.matt.j@gmail.com or DM at @kingfalcon on Twitter.

About
I have been lucky enough to spend the past 12 years making a career out of being empathetic and curious. I've immersed myself in a wide variety of industries and built products for parents, recruiters, education providers, truck drivers, reinsurance professionals and women in the workforce to name a few.

I believe that great product people are motivated by a desire to understand and improve the lives of the humans who use their products AND the humans who work with them to build those products.

It is important to me to:
- Create and nurture psychologically safe teams
- Build useful, simple and profitable products
- Collect qualitative and quantitative data to inform decisions

About
I have the fortunate opportunity to lead a talented team of product managers, focused on solving real user needs, with a proven track record of transforming technically complex landscapes into delightful, well-adopted user experiences. In my 15+ years working in the tech sector, I have learned that persistent, creative innovation is only made possible by inclusive, collaborative work environments, and I evangelize those principles every day, with the goal of building products and people capable of transformative impact.

--

Core focuses of mine currently include: product management, people management, UX design, brand strategy, marketing, cross-functional leadership, diversity and inclusion, process excellence, business development, team culture, mobile, and growth. In my personal time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors with my wife and toddler, deploying and managing open source software in my homelab, home automation, researching alternative energy and electric mobility, and I also love a strong coffee and unwonted book recommendations.

About
I'm passionate about technology that solves real problems, with a knack for algorithmic, optimization, or machine learning challenges, proven to perform under pressure. I have a heavy background in algorithms & data structures, and machine learning, worked at Coinbase, Twitter, Facebook, Google, and IBM research, and won or made the onsite final at some of the biggest programming contests in the world, like Google Code Jam or TopCoder Open.

Most recently, I was the first ML Engineer at Coinbase, acting as the team's tech lead for the last three years over a 40+ team. I had a role in building, designing, or advising every ML model running in production currently at Coinbase, as well as the technical and strategic direction. Highlights:

Landed double-digit increases in site-wide net revenue and engagement across the Feed, Growth & Notifications, and user spend limits;
Created Auto-ML-like lego-blocks around tabular data, sequence & text data (using Transformers of ChatGPT fame & deep learning), and support for blending these models to help 10x the team;
Set long-term technical direction for the team, owned large parts of the interview process, published a blog post around our stack, contributed to a KDD presentation, and ran a knowledge-sharing group and boot camp;
Worked on the first web3 use cases.

I was a founding engineer at Memo.ai (acquired by Coinbase) working on various NLP tasks. Previously, I did big data work at BitDefender and got my first industry experience through internships at Google (2008), Facebook (2010), and Twitter (2012).

Published several theoretical computer science papers in string algorithms and strand detection, with an h-index of 4.

I also built the first real-time turnout electoral map for the Romanian parliamentary elections, used by more than 1% of the Romanian voting population.

I have Research Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, College Park, under Prof. Mohammad HajiAghayi and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Bucharest, Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics.

About
As a Sales Enablement Analyst, I am passionate about cross-functional teamwork and communication. With data, improved processes, and consistent, ongoing conversations at the core of what I do, I strive to be a thought leader that facilitates connections at the intersection of sales, marketing, and product development.

I am also dedicated to a growth mindset, asking questions at every opportunity and aiming to learn a new skill or piece of information every day. When I have a (rare) spare moment, you can find me watching tutorials and reading up on best practices for tools like Tableau and SugarCRM or on projects like NPI process improvement and newsletter composition. This personal motivation means that I am always seeking new challenges or new methods of tackling old ones. Let's connect!

I currently work in Sales Operations, supporting DH Pace Commercial Inside and Outside Sales Teams. For me, it’s all about connections - between people, to ideas, or to information. 

Outside the office, I’m likely planning the intricate details of my next National Park trip or experimenting with new recipes.

About
Throughout my career I've enjoyed challenging myself to find new and uniquely challenging roles. These different experiences enable me to quickly adapt, learn new solutions and build rapport with clients and colleagues. I'm also able to provide valuable feedback and implement changes that produce positive and lasting impacts to the business. I ensure my actions and decisions take into account the perspective and best interests of the customer, my company and myself. This approach enables me to create unique solutions and ensures that I'm always open to the input and perspective of everyone else. I firmly believe that a job/ a role/ an assignment is what what you make it out to be. I know that in order to be successful you must expect your responsibilities can and will go beyond the job description.

I've had continued success throughout my career in multiple industries. The roles I held were primarily in sales and management, though my experiences go well beyond those two areas.

About
I am a resourceful product/account manager with 12+ years of experience, most recently in apparel, increasing sales revenue and profitability, utilizing systems to augment team productivity, determining client needs, and delivering impeccable results, and would like to bring my expertise to an organization with high standards and vision. I devise marketing plans and sales training curricula to upgrade employee capabilities. If you need a visionary with a track record for finding innovative ways to grow revenue and increase margins, I am your person. I also have a history of success, leading initiatives for sales and training. I was consistently brought over to new roles to increase sales and market new product lines. My kids are grown, and I am looking for the right opportunity to truly deep dive into a career in my passion of product management.

About
Computer Science and Computational Math Double Major at Rochester Institute of Technology.
Established track record of combining software engineering, mathematical/statistical data analysis,
and machine learning. I write high-performing code and scripts for organizations to help them
generate more revenue, identify areas of investment, isolate redundancies, and automate
processes.

Proven work experience in Machine Learning and Software Development. Contributions in
various fields like Disease Detection, Climate Modeling, Health System Analysis, Valuable Customer
Identification, DeepFake Detection, Automated Machine Learning, Supply Chain Forecasting, Text Analysis, and English to SQL translation.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated my ability to work independently to attain results. I have
been involved in projects from the data collection phase all the way to model deployment and
retraining. My employers have ranged from large, multi-national corporations, state governments to
small startups. This has given insight into the various intricacies of implementing effective Machine
Learning and AI systems at all levels/stages. My creativity, deep technical knowledge, and
effectiveness have been acknowledged by all my co-workers and can be seen through my LinkedIn
recommendations.

Notable Achievements:
-) My work with Johns Hopkins University was acknowledged and used to guide Healthcare System policy for a State Government.
-) Automated various pipelines to build no-code Machine Learning solutions for Clientell. These solutions were able to raise millions of dollars in funding.
-) Identified high-value prospective customers for ICICI Bank with 95% accuracy. This allowed the bank to improve profits and save resources by only pursuing valuable leads.
-) Codeveloped an algorithm to Detect Parkinson’s Disease using voice samples. The algorithm was competitive with Apple despite using fewer resources.
-)My Content: ""Machine Learning Made Simple"" is global. Uzbek people watch my videos. My articles have been translated into multiple languages including Spanish and Malay. Students in Singapore have used my material to understand concepts.
-) I once got 19 strangers into a tree with me. Willingly. On a Friday Night. It's really hard. Try it if you don't believe me
